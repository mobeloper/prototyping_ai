    "# Understanding TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore **TF-IDF**, a powerful technique for text representation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). TF-IDF measures the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand the concept of TF-IDF and its components: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).\n",
    "2. Learn how to compute TF-IDF using `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "3. Visualize the results in a tabular format.\n",
    "4. Understand the calculations behind TF-IDF for specific terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "TF-IDF combines two metrics:\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a term appears in a document.\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How unique a term is across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for TF-IDF is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(t\\): Term\n",
    "- \\(d\\): Document\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\text{IDF}(t) = \\log(\\frac{N}{1 + \\text{DF}(t)})$, where \\(N\\) is the total number of documents, and $\\text{DF}(t)$ is the number of documents containing the term \\(t\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will compute the TF-IDF values for a small set of sample documents.\n"
